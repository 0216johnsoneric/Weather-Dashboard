# Weather-Dashboard: 
Weather Dashboard is a dynamic API application that is tasked with retrieving data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and uses the data to display the current forecast along with the next 5-Day forecast for a locally searched city.  
When a user searches for a local city they are presented with current and future forecasts. The data displayed includes: The city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
Some additional functionality include a colored UV index that indicates if the whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. A weather icon also indicates weather conditions. localStorage is implemented to save city search history and the last city that was searched for when the application is initially deployed.
